* WebCollab 3.50 - Nihoniho *
-----------------------------

  "Those who can imagine anything, can create the impossible." 

     --- Alan Turing


* What's New *
--------------

Welcome to WebCollab 3.50:

The database tables have been overhauled to avoid the use of reserved column names in MySQL 8 and
similar potentially reserved names in PostgreSQL.  This code factor is deeply invasive and it is 
possible some unusual cases could reveal bugs.  Please report any bugs found by filing a report. 

Because of the column name changes, upgrading of all earlier versions of WebCollab is required 
before using this version.  See upgrade motes below.

The minimum version of PHP is now set at 7.0.0.  This allows several code enhancements and deletion of 
legacy code that was required to support earlier PHP versions.

Enjoy!

* Setup Program *
-----------------

WebCollab has a web-based setup program.

- After unpacking the files, point your web browser at:

    http://your_site/webcollab-3.50/setup.php

  (Replace 'your_site' with your site address).

  ** You will need to make your /config/config.php file world writable **

- Follow the on screen instructions.

For more detailed instructions look in the /docs directory after unpacking.

- The optional PHP OpenSSL library should be installed.


* Database Compatibility for Upgrading *
----------------------------------------

Before attempting to run with any existing database records from a version earlier than WebCollab
 3.50 you need to upgrade your database.  This can be done automatically by the WebCollab software
for any earlier version of WebCollab.

Point your browser at:

  http://your_site/webcollab-3.50/update.php

(You need to replace 'your_site' with your site address).

Enter a valid admin user name and password when prompted... Database upgrade is automatic.

Backing up your database before upgrading is recommended.


* Running Setup after an Upgrade *
----------------------------------

After an upgrade setup must be run to incorporate the new configuration changes.

1. Open the file [webcollab]/config/config.php with your favourite text editor.  Find this line:

   $WEB_CONFIG = "N";

   It is near the top of the file.  Change "N" to "Y".

2. Make sure the file world writable - or, at least writable by the webserver.

3. Point your web browser at:

    http://your_site/webcollab-3.50/setup.php

4. Make sure to choose 'no' when prompted to create a new database....

5. Follow the on screen instructions.
